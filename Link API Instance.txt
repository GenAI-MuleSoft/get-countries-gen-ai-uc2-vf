'm a senior Mulesoft developer and I developed an application in Anypoint studio. I already deployed it to Runtime manager and application working fine. Also I pushed API to exchange. Now I need Link API asset in Exchange with latest version of API in Runtime

Certainly! Linking an API asset in Exchange with its runtime instance allows you to trace back the running API instance from Exchange, providing a clear linkage between the design and runtime environments. Here's how to link your API asset in Exchange to the deployed API instance in Runtime Manager:

API Manager Integration:

Ensure that Anypoint Platform’s API Manager is integrated with Exchange and Runtime Manager. This is essential because when you deploy an API to Runtime, API Manager needs to be aware of it so that it can manage and apply policies to the API.
Autodiscovery Configuration:

In your Mule application, ensure you've added the Autodiscovery configuration. This helps the API Gateway component of the Runtime to recognize the deployed API.
To add the Autodiscovery configuration, you need to configure the global element in Anypoint Studio. Navigate to the Global Elements view, create an Autodiscovery element, and associate it with the API definition from Exchange.
Deployment Configuration:

When deploying your API to CloudHub or your own hosted runtime, ensure you set the API Autodiscovery property.
In CloudHub, under the “Properties” tab, you would typically set something like:
scss
Copy code
anypoint.platform.gatekeeper=disabled
api.name=your-api-name
api.version=your-api-version
Here, your-api-name and your-api-version correspond to the name and version of your API in API Manager/Exchange.
Linking in API Manager:

Go to Anypoint Platform's API Manager.
Locate your API, which should reflect the same name/version as in the autodiscovery settings.
Once inside, you should see a section for Active Deployments. Here, the current running instances (or endpoints) of your API will be displayed.
If done correctly, you'll see your CloudHub deployment or your own runtime endpoint linked here.
Verifying in Exchange:

Now, if you navigate to Exchange and find your API asset, there should be an option to view the Active Implementations or endpoints, which shows the currently running versions of your API.
Remember, the key here is to ensure that API Manager knows about your API and that when you deploy your API, the runtime knows which API in API Manager it corresponds to. This linkage is established using the Autodiscovery feature.

Lastly, always ensure you have the required permissions to link assets and manage APIs. Some settings might be restricted based on your role in the Anypoint Platform. If you face any issues, it might be beneficial to check with your platform admin or consult Mulesoft documentation and support forums.
